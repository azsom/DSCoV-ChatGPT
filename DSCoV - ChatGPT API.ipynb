    "- GPT is short for Generative Pre-trained Transformer model\n",
    "    - it provides text outputs in response to text inputs (prompts)\n",
    "    - prompts have four goals:\n",
    "        - ask a question \n",
    "        - provide detailed instructions\n",
    "        - provide some examples of how to successfully complete a task\n",
    "        - provide domain knowledge ChatGPT needs to know to complete a task\n",
    "- ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) improved by reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)\n",
    "- You can interact with it in two ways:\n",
    "    - web interface: https://chat.openai.com/\n",
    "        - free or \\$20/month for a ChatGPT Plus plan \n",
    "    - API access mostly for developers to build chat-based applications\n",
    "        - token-based, I paid less than \\$0.05 to develop and test code for this talk\n"

       "'\"Abilify 20 mg.\\r\\nI am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don&#039;t feel out of the normal with any &quot;sexual frustration&quot;...and I wouldn&#039;t say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&#039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.\\r\\nAbilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. \\r\\nMy thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.  \\r\\nI don&#039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.\"'"
